This is a program to analyse the IMBD movie file

The classes for this program:
• Films: This class will hold an instance variable that is a list containing Film objects.
The Films class has the following methods:
– readFile: This takes a single parameter that is the string path to the location
of the file containing film information. The file will be stored as an
instance variable
– createFilmsList: This method will access the instance variable containing
the file information and append Film objects to the list created in the constructor. 
This should not create a Film object for the header in the file.
– getFilmsList: This takes no parameters and returns the instance variable containing the list of Film objects.
• Film: This class contains the data about a film. In the constructor it will
be passed the title, year of release and runtime. These will be stored as instance
variables. The Film class will also contain getter methods for each of the
instance variables. e.g getTitle() etc.


Methods:
• Creates a Films object that will hold the data about the IMDB Top 1000 films (from imdb.csv.)
• Print to the screen the string representations of the films that have a runtime of less than 
70 minutes and any films in the list published after 2019, in the following format for each Film:
“The Shawshank Redemption was released in 1994 and has a runtime of 142 minutes.”
